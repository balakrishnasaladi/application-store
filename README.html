<h4>Technical Challenge Store application to calculate basket price</h4>

<h3>Design approach and assumptions</h3> 
<p>
In this design user will add products in command prompt with product name.
So quantity is not added at Basket level attribute, rather we count products.


As its not mentioned in requirement, for simplicity assuming one product will have one offer.
Changes needed to current design for supporting One product having multiple offers.
</p>

<h3>Areas of improvements:</h3>

<p>
Cart must wrapped as object rather than Map. So that we can have subtotal, total.
Read CVS file using 3rd party Utility so that data can be read column by column and allow to add special characters.
</p>

<h3>Command to run the application:</h3>
<p>
java -jar application-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar</p>

<p>Need to copy the .cvs files to a location and path of the files need to be changed</p>
